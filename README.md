# Multi-Agent Frontend Developer

Our goal is to create a state-of-the art multi-agent framework which can be used to create frontend applications. The framework leverages open-source and closed-source LLMs for development. Multiple agents work and communicate together until a good result is achieved.

This project builds on top of ChatDev which is just able to create simple games:
